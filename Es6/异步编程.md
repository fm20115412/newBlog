### 异步的概念：
- **delaying execution of a function until a particular time**
```
$('#btn').on('click', () =>
  console.log('Callbacks are everywhere')
)
```
In the jQuery example, is delaying execution of a function until a particular time. “Hey, here’s this function. Go ahead and invoke it whenever the element with an id of btn is clicked.” 

- **delay execution of a function until we have the data we need**
```
$.getJSON({
  url: `https://api.github.com/users/${id}`,
  success: updateUI,
  error: showError,
})
```
We can’t update the UI of our app until we have the user’s data. So what do we do? We say, “Hey, here’s an object. If the request succeeds, go ahead and call success passing it the user’s data. If it doesn’t, go ahead and call error passing it the error object.
